Creating a blog has been on my To-Do list for a while now, and I finally took the time to research the process over the weekend. I was surprised at the relative ease of the process now as I haven't done much web design in the last decade or so.

Over the coming months I am planning to share my experiences in software testing, test automation and data science. I'll probably toss in some stuff on home servers, home automation, learning Linux and my early attempts at Alexa Skills when I have some time to work on some side projects. 

A big thanks to konsumer's [Gatsby Bootstrap Netlify Starter](https://github.com/konsumer/gatsby-starter-bootstrap-netlify) that helped me to get this Gatsby blog up and running on [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/). I'll hopefully have some posts about customizing Gatsby in the future as I gain some experience.

Go Tigers!
